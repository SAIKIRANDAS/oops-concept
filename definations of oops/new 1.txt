object:
    instance of class; is nothing but getting the details of the class for cfeating the object.
class:
    collection of objects; 
Abstraction:
       hiding the unwanted data, hiding the complexity of design; 
	   abstract can be achived by using access specifier; i.e public(any one can access the data),private(it can be access by the user),protect(it will be protected from the public).
encaptulation:
binding the data in asingle unit is nothing but hold the data i.e dta member and member function in a single unit.
inheritence:we can access the base class by using the derived class by using the properties baseclass.

polymorphism:one task can perform many ways that is nothing but there is no changes in the method.
   1)method overloading :it is nothing but method will wont change but the parameters and signatures will get the changes 
   2)method overriding   :it is nothing but there is no changes in the method  but changes occurs in functionality. in this will use concepts called as virtual,override.
abstract class: in abstract class it caan be declared but not be defined. what ever the methods are created in abstractclass all are abstract methods.
interface: A class can inherit from a class or from an interface.
constructor :constructor is nothing but method and while creating the object method will automatically created.
